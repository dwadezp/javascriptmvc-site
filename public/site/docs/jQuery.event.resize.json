c({"name": "jQuery.event.resize", "type": "page", "comment": "<p><code>jQuery.event.resize</code> provides the <code>resize</code> event wich is useful for updating element dimensions when a parent element\nhas been resized. It allows you to only resize elements that need to be resized\nin the 'right order'.</p>\n\n<p>By listening to a resize event, you will be alerted whenever a parent\nelement has a <code>resize</code> event triggered on it.  For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('#foo').bind('resize', function(){\n  // adjust #foo's dimensions\n})\n\n$(document.body).trigger(\"resize\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>The 'Right Order'</h2>\n\n<p>When a control changes size, typically, you want only internal controls to have to adjust their\ndimensions.  Furthermore, you want to adjust controls from the 'outside-in', meaning\nthat the outermost control adjusts its dimensions before child controls adjust theirs.</p>\n\n<p><code>jQuery.event.resize</code> calls <code>resize</code> events in exactly this manner.</p>\n\n<p>When you trigger a <code>resize</code> event, it will propagate up the DOM until it reaches\nan element with the first resize event\nhandler.  There it will move the event in the opposite direction, calling the element's\nchildren's resize event handlers.</p>\n\n<p>If your intent is to call <code>resize</code> without bubbling and only trigger child element's handlers,\nuse the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(\"#foo\").trigger(\"resize\", false);\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Stopping Children Updates</h2>\n\n<p>If your element doesn't need to change it's dimensions as a result of the parent element, it should\ncall <code>event.stopPropagation()</code>.  This will only stop <code>resize</code> from being sent to child elements of the current element.</p>\n\n<h2>Example</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>resize</code> event is very helpful for creating application like layouts. The following example uses  [jQuery.dimensions] and the <code>resize</code> event to implement a common layout. Just drag the blue square to resize the container:</p>\n\n<iframe style=\"width: 100%; height: 350px\" src=\"http://jsfiddle.net/TcB5y/embedded/result,html,js,css\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\">JSFiddle</iframe>\n\n<h2>Demo</h2>\n\n<div class='demo_wrapper' data-demo-src='jquery/event/resize/demo.html'></div>", "parents": ["jquerypp"], "src": "jquery/event/resize/resize.md", "children": []})
