If a different unit is used for the border's width,\nthen you will need to use the top and left settings as explained below.</p>\n\n<p><em>NOTICE</em>: This plugin has been reported to cause perfromance problems\nwhen used on elements that change properties (like width, height and\nopacity) a lot in IE6. Most of these problems have been caused by \nthe expressions used to calculate the elements width, height and \nborders. Some have reported it is due to the opacity filter. All \nthese settings can be changed if needed as explained below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>new can.ui.layout.Bgiframe($('div'));\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe class=\"bgiframe\".../&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This plugin was adapted from the jQueryUI bgiframe plugin, which can be\nfound <a href=\"http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/bgiframe\">here</a>.</p>", "parents": ["canui"], "params": {"settings": {"order": 0, "description": "<ul>\n<li><p>settings to configure the iframe.</p></li>\n<li><p><code>{String|Number}</code> top The iframe must be offset to the top\n    by the width of the top border.
