When you steal a plugin like steal(\"jquery/controller\"), \n the plugin path is joined with this rootUrl to create a full path \n to the controller.js file.</p>\n\n<p>By default, the rootUrl is calculated from the\n steal script and the window location.  For example, if the \n script tag looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code class='javascript'>  <script type='text/javascript' src='../../steal/steal.js?ui/app'></script></code></pre> \n\n<p>rootUrl will be set to \"../../\".\n Setting the rootUrl can be useful if you want to have\n steal.js in a different location.</p>\n\n<p>## Example</p>\n\n<p>The following sets steal root to a different folder.</p>\n\n<pre><code> steal.rootUrl(\"../../jmvc/\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This appends  <code>\"../../jmvc\"</code> to paths\n loaded from [steal.static.root].  In some strange cases this might be desirable if \n plugin folders are in a different location from the steal directory. </p>\n\n<p>It also sets the current url to this directory so the first calls to steal work relative to the root JMVC directory.</p>", "src": "steal/steal.js", "children": []})
