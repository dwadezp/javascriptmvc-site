C({"name": "contacts", "type": "page", "comment": "<h1>Contacts</h1>\n\n<p>Contacts is a application that allows users to add and organize their friend's contact information.</p>\n\n<p>This article describes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How to install the application</li>\n<li>The application’s functionality</li>\n<li>How the application was built</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"images/contacts-preview.jpg\" alt=\"Contacts App\" title=\"Contacts App\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Getting the source</h2>\n\n<p>The application source is hosted by <a href=\"http://www.github.com\">GitHub</a>; you can either download the application directly from the website <a href=\"https://github.com/jupiterjs/contacts\">https://github.com/jupiterjs/contacts</a> or clone the code using the following commands:</p>\n\n<p><em>Clone files to your local drive</em>  </p>\n\n<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/jupiterjs/contacts.git\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>Navigate to application directory and initialize submodules</em>  </p>\n\n<pre><code>$ cd contacts  \n$ git submodule init  \n$ git submodule update\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>Note: If you download it from the website, you will also need to download <a href=\"https://github.com/jupiterjs/javascriptmvc\">JavascriptMVC</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jupiterjs/mxui\">MXUI</a>.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Running the application</h2>\n\n<p>Once you get the application from GitHub you should have structure similar to below. </p>\n\n<pre><code>/todo [top-level, the GitHub repo]\n      /jquery\n        /class\n        /controller\n        /model\n        /view\n        jquery.js\n        ...\n      /steal\n        /build\n        /generate\n        js\n        js.bat\n        steal.js\n        ...\n      /funcunit\n        /qunit\n          qunit.js\n          ...\n    /scripts\n        /test\n        funcunit.html\n        funcunit.js\n        qunit.html\n        ...\n      /contacts\n        /scripts\n        /test\n        /models\n        /fixtures\n        /views\n        funcunit.html\n        qunit.html\n        contacts.css\n        contacts.js\n        ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To run the application, you can either run it from the file system or you can put it in an IIS or apache virtual directory.  We will be using fixtures to simulate the server responses so running it in a server configuration really isn’t necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Either way once you’re set, just open contacts/contacts.html in your favorite web browser, preferably Firefox.  <em>Note: If you choose to run it from the file system, you will have cross-origin security issues with Chrome.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Organization / Structure of the Application</h2>\n\n<p>The application is organized in a sense that everything is a widget.  This is a slightly different approach than applications are typically organized, as a big application with widgets in them.  This pattern and organization technique allows us to get the most re-use out of the widgets.  As we continue to build on the application, we simply just add more widgets.   </p>\n\n<p>This application is broken down into 3 main modules to help us organize the application; these are: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>contacts</li>\n<li>jupiter</li>\n<li>MXUI</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>MXUI</h3>\n\n<p>MXUI is the third module in our application.  MXUI is a widget library managed by Jupiter Consulting group.  It contains a set of low-level widgets that help you accomplish annoying things developers often have to face when building complex widgets.  It’s not intended to be another jQuery widget library but instead simple widgets and utilities to help you build the bigger picture.  </p>\n\n<p>One example of a MXUI widget we are using in this application is: MXUI.Data.List.  List is a simple widget that given a model it will list the results.  Additionally, List will listen for update and destroy events to update the list accordingly.  In the next section, we will talk about developing highly reusable widgets like this one.</p>\n\n<p>This is just one of many widgets you will find the library including several others like: Grid, List, Menuable, and many more. This project is open source and available on <a href=\"https://github.com/jupiterjs/mxui\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Jupiter</h3>\n\n<p>Jupiter is the second module you will find in our application.  Jupiter is where independent widgets and utilities go that could be used in any application.  These widgets should NOT be coupled to the contacts widget and would be very generic in nature so that you might re-use them on another project.  </p>\n\n<p>One example of a widget we are using in this application is the <em>jupiter/style/style.js</em>.  Style is a widget that will style headers and box elements using jQueryUI CSS classes.</p>\n\n<pre><code>steal('jquery').then(function($){\n    var style$ = jQuery.sub();\n    style$.extend(style$.fn,{\n        box : function(){\n            return this.addClass('ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all')\n            },\n            header : function(){\n                return this.addClass('ui-helper-reset ui-state-active')\n                },\n                $ : function(){\n                    return $(this);\n                }\n                });\n                $.fn.style$ = function(){\n                    return style$(this)\n                }\n            })\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see this could be used in any application you might be leveraging the jQueryUI CSS themes.  </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the folder doesn’t have to be named jupiter either, it should be named after the organization that would be using the widgets; this why I named it <em>Jupiter</em>.</p>\n\n<h3>Contacts</h3>\n\n<p>The contacts widget is the primary widget in the application.  This widget will be where the application starts and will act as a master controller gluing all the widgets together.  When this widget is added to the page it will bring all the secondary widgets with it and then begin initializing them with the appropriate settings for the application.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$.Controller(\"Contacts.Controller\", {\n    init: function(){\n\n        this.params = new Mxui.Data();\n\n        $(\"#category .list_wrapper\").mxui_data_list({\n            model : Contacts.Models.Category,\n            show : \"//contacts/views/categoryList\",\n            create: \"//contacts/views/categoryCreate\"\n        });\n\n        $(\"#location .list_wrapper\").mxui_data_list({\n            model : Contacts.Models.Location,\n            show : \"//contacts/views/categoryList\",\n            create: \"//contacts/views/categoryCreate\"\n        });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The contacts widget will also listen for events on the widgets it initialized using JavascriptMVC event delegation to help facilitate cross-widget communication.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"#category .list_wrapper activate\": function(el, ev, item){\n    this.params.attr(\"categoryId\", item.id);\n}, \n\"#category .list_wrapper deactivate\": function(el, ev, item){\n    this.params.attr(\"categoryId\", null);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the next section, we will touch more on the pattern used to facilitate this cross-widget communication.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally in the contacts widget, you will find the building blocks of any JavascriptMVC application; models for communication with the server, fixtures for simulating AJAX responses from the server, and functional tests for testing the application as a whole.</p>\n\n<h2>Architecture of the App</h2>\n\n<p>The contacts application is broken down into 4 main modules: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Category</li>\n<li>Company</li>\n<li>Locations</li>\n<li>Contacts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Over the next few topics, we will go through designing the widgets that live in these modules, cross-widget communication using event-orientated architecture and the observer pattern, and how all this ties together to create this elegant application.</p>\n\n<h3>Designing the Widgets</h3>\n\n<p>The goal of designing any widget is to provide the application’s end-user an easy way to interact with the page.  The widget should encapsulate as much complexity as possible making it easy for the developer to implement.  Oftentimes too many of us developers develop these one off widgets that could easily be obfuscated into a more abstract sense.  </p>\n\n<p>When designing this application’s widgets, we tried to take the widgets that we developers time-and-time-again develop into abstract entities that would allow us to use it whether we were building a game or a CRM application.</p>\n\n<p>This application has 2 main widgets in it, <em>MXUI.Data.List</em> and <em>MXUI.Data.Grid</em>.  I want to go through the list widget with you over the next topic to explain how you can design your widgets for maximum re-use.</p>\n\n<h4>How MXUI.Data.List is designed</h4>\n\n<p>The category, location, and company are all filters for primary contacts grid.  Upon clicking one of these filters, the grid is then filtered using the selection.  These 3 filter all leverage <em>MXUI.Data.List</em>. </p>\n\n<p>We slightly touched on the list in an above topic when talking about the MXUI library but to reiterate, the List is a simple widget that given a model it will list the results and listen for updates to the items to update and/or destroy the UI. </p>\n\n<pre><code>$(\"#category .list_wrapper\").mxui_data_list({\n    model : Contacts.Models.Category,\n    show : \"//contacts/views/categoryList\",\n    create: \"//contacts/views/categoryCreate\"\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When initialized, you pass the List your model to which it will be listing the items from.  Since all models have a standard API designed after a <em>RESTful</em> architecture for fetching items, we leverage that by executing a <em>findAll</em>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.options.model.findAll(this.options.params, this.callback('list'))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you look in our models, you won’t see any code sense we encapsulated all this into the base model for you.  If you dig through <em>jquery/model/model.js</em> you will find this code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>return function(params, success, error){\n    return ajax(str || this.shortName+\"s.json\", \n        params, \n        success, \n        error, \n        fixture.call(this,\"s\"),\n        get\",\n        \"json \"+this._shortName+\".models\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also in the initialization code, you will find we pass a show view.  After the model has completed its <em>findAll</em>, we will take those results and draw the UI from them.</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.element.html(this.options.list,{\n    items : this.options.sort ? items.sort(this.options.sort) : items,\n    options: this.options\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Rarely ever after you draw a list will it stay the same.  Fortunately, List will listen for updates and deletes of items using the model that was passed to it to keep its list up-to-date as the application is used.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"{model} updated\" : function(model, ev, item){\n    var el = item.elements(this.element).html(this.options.show, item);\n    if(this.options.updated){\n        this.options.updated(this.element, el, item)\n    }\n},\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the next topic, we will discuss using this type of observer architecture so don’t fret if you’re not sure about the last bit of code.</p>\n\n<p>As items are clicked in the list, we listen for these events using event delegation and apply a selected visual state to the item.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\".item {activateEvent}\" : function(el, ev){\n    if(el.hasClass(\"activated\")){\n        this._deactivate(el)\n    } else {\n        var old = this.find(\".activated\");\n        this._deactivate(old);\n        this._activate(el);\n    }\n},\n_deactivate: function(el){\n    el.removeClass(\"activated\");\n    el.trigger(\"deactivate\", el.model());\n},\n_activate: function(el){\n    el.addClass(\"activated\");\n    el.trigger(\"activate\", el.model());\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It also triggers a activate event which the contacts master widget listens for and reacts accordingly on.  In the next topic, I will discuss this type of event-oriented-architecture more in-depth.</p>\n\n<p>The mission of this widget was simple; create a list of things that updates itself as the items change.  Yet you and I have probably wrote this a dozen times in our applications we have created ourselves.  The key to unlocking the unlimited potential of re-use is to create a widget with the simplest and most generic API as possible.  This exemplifies these traits by only passing a model and view.  The widget does the rest of the magic, making for a very elegant implementation in your application.</p>\n\n<p>Another example that leverages List is our <a href=\"http://javascriptmvc.com/todo/\">Todo Application</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Event-oriented-architecture</h2>\n\n<p>Traditional widget architecture often either involves passing around callbacks and/or trigger DOM events when actions are completed.  This type of architecture in not desirable for many reasons, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The widget should be as dumb as possible.  Therefore, when you pass a callback your widget becomes coupled to its parent widget because it becomes aware of the context it’s used.  Secondly, if you have your widget listening for various DOM events from child widgets, you are coupling it as well.</p></li>\n<li><p>When you pass callbacks, only one other widget can listen for that callback.  It creates a 1-to-1 architecture, which limits the scalability of the application.</p></li>\n<li><p>Passing callbacks clutters the API and becomes a burdensome for new developers trying to learn all the callbacks available for the widget.</p></li>\n<li><p>DOM Events can introduce an extra communication point with the controller layer that isn’t always necessary.  Sometimes, you might want to simply talk directly to the model layer.  For instance, in our grid in the contacts application when you page to the next page, we want update the model directly passing the new filter.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Events are defined as significant change in state.  EOA is a pattern that is defined by the detection and consumption of these changes in state.   Rather than taking the traditional architecture approach that I slated above and inheriting its flaws, we decided to craft the contacts application using this EOA architecture. </p>\n\n<h3>Model Events</h3>\n\n<p>Model events are events that are fired when CRUD operations (create/update/delete) occur on a model instance.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier in the article, I teased you with a glimpse of the model events used in the List design section.  We were mentioning how the list would keep itself up-to-date listening for created, updated, and destroyed events from the model.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"{model} updated\" : function(model, ev, item){\n    var el = item.elements(this.element).html(this.options.show, item);\n    if(this.options.updated){\n        this.options.updated(this.element, el, item)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this example, as model changes are made, such as an update to a contact name; we listen for these changes in the List and update the UI accordingly.</p>\n\n<h3>Examples of EOA</h3>\n\n<p>As items are clicked in the list, the list bubbles the activate event to the master contact widget passing an instance of the item’s model that was selected.  </p>\n\n<pre><code>el.trigger(\"activate\", el.model());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>Pro Tip:  Because we bound instances of models using EJS, in our controller code we can call .model() on the element that was bound to retrieve the model.</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;% for(var i =0 ; i &lt; items.length;i ++){ %&gt;\n      &lt;li &lt;%= items[i]%&gt; &gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The contacts widget then observes this change in state using event delegation and updates the grid parameters.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"#category .list_wrapper activate\": function(el, ev, item){\n    this.params.attr(\"categoryId\", item.id);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"images/eoa-diagram1.jpg\" alt=\"EOA Example 1\" title=\"EOA Example 1\" /></p>\n\n<p>The grid parameters are a model instance that is defined in <em>MXUI.Data</em>.  This model model has some preset attributes, defaults, and helper methods for using when listing items in widgets such as a grid.  It defines things such as: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>limit - the maximum number of items to come back</li>\n<li>offset – the current “page” we might be on</li>\n<li>count – the total number of items</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the sample code above you see we do <em>attr</em> on this model object to updates the model instance’s current parameters.  The JavascriptMVC Model implements an observer pattern so as changes are made to its attributes, widgets can listen for the <em>updated</em> event to be trigger and react accordingly.  </p>\n\n<p>In our case, the grid is listening for changes of the attributes.  When we triggered the activate above and changes the <em>categoryId</em> of the params object the grid observes this change and consequently executes a new AJAX request to update its view. </p>\n\n<pre><code>\"{params} updated.attr\" : function(params, ev, attr, val){\n    if(attr !== 'count'){\n        //want to throttle for rapid updates\n        clearTimeout(this.newRequestTimer,100)\n        this.newRequestTimer = setTimeout(this.callback('newRequest', attr, val))\n    }\n},\n\nnewRequest : function(attr, val){\n    var clear = true; \n    if(!this.options.newPageClears &amp;&amp; attr == \"offset\"){ // if offset changes and we have newPageClears false\n        clear = false;\n    } \n    this.options.model.findAll(this.options.params.attrs(), this.callback('list', clear))\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"images/eoa-diagram2.jpg\" alt=\"EOA Example 2\" title=\"EOA Example 2\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Wrap-up</h2>\n\n<p>Good architecture is very difficult to accomplish; quoting Leonardo da Vinci: <em>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication</em>.  </p>\n\n<p>Echoing his quote, I feel that once you have broken your application down into the simplest components that make your application a whole, it’s easy to construct easy-to-use widgets that exhibit maximum re-usability. </p>\n\n<p>Now that you’ve read this article, hopefully you have not only a better understanding of JavascriptMVC and the features encapsulated in it, but can make good architectural decisions when designing your application whether its with JavascriptMVC or not.</p>", "title": "Contacts", "parents": ["examples"], "order": 1, "src": "tutorials/contacts.md", "children": []})
