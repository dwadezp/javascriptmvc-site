C({"name": "gettingstarted", "type": "page", "comment": "<p>Welcome to the getting started guide!  This getting started guide walks \nyou through creating a simple cookbook app that uses all core parts of \nJavaScriptMVC.  It's purpose is to give you a high level overview of JavaScriptMVC's functionality.</p>\n\n<h2>Breakdown</h2>\n\n<p>JavaScriptMVC is divided into 4 independent sub projects:</p>\n\n<p>jQueryMX - jQuery MVC and other extensions.\nStealJS - Dependency Managment and build tool system.\nDocumentJS - A documentation Engine\nFuncUnit - A web testing framework</p>\n\n<p>Every project has different needs.  Your project might not need (or even \nwant) to use all of JavaScriptMVC.  That's fine because each part of \nJavaScriptMVC works without every other part. If you want only want one \npart, click that part above and you'll be directed to it's getting \nstarted guide.</p>\n\n<h2>jQueryMX</h2>\n\n<p>jQueryMX is a collection of useful jQuery extensions broken down\ninto four broad categories:</p>\n\n<h3>Model-View-Controller</h3>\n\n<p>Model lets you connect to services and model data - getting events when data changes.</p>\n\n<p>View provides templates.</p>\n\n<p>Controller.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DOM Extensions</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Special Events</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Language Helpers</strong></p>\n\n<h2>StealJS</h2>\n\n<p>StealJS is a dependency management and build tool system.  It packs tons of useful scripts that help you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Load JavaScript, CSS, Less, CoffeeScript, and templates.</li>\n<li>Combine and minifiy files into fewer and smaller downloads.</li>\n<li>Lint and beautify scripts</li>\n<li>Log messages that </li>\n<li>Install 3rd party scripts and dependencies</li>\n<li>Generate Google crawl-able pages of your ajax apps.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Loading Scripts</h3>\n\n<p>Load scripts by \nadding <code>steal/steal.js</code> to your page with the path to your script\nin the querystring:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type='text/javascript'\n        src='../steal/steal.js?cookbook/cookbook.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, use steal to load any files you need:</p>\n\n<pre><code>steal('widgets/list',\n      'models/recipe.js')\n.then('views/recipes.ejs', \n      function(){\n        // runs when everything else has finished\n      })\n</code></pre>", "src": "jmvc/pages/gettingstarted.md", "children": []})
