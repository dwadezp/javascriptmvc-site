FuncUnit does not perform the selection until a\ncommand is called upon this selector.  This makes aliasing the selectors to\nJavaScript variables a great technique.</p>\n\n<h5>Function</h5>\n\n<p>If a function is provided, it will add that function to the action queue to be run\nafter previous actions and waits.</p>\n\n<h5>Object</h5>\n\n<p>If you want to reference the window or document, pass <code>S.window</code> \nor <code>S.window.document</code> to the selector.  </p>\n\n<p>{Number} [context] If provided, the context is the frame number in the\ndocument.frames array to use as the context of the selector.  For example, if you\nwant to select something in the first iframe of the page:</p>\n\n<pre><code>S(\"a.mylink\",0)\n</code></pre>", "title": "2.1 The S Method", "parents": ["FuncUnit"], "src": "funcunit/pages/s.md", "children": []})
