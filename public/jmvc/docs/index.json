It packages best-of-bread\nlibraries and tools that are guaranteed (and tested) to work together.  It\nsupports every browser that jQuery supports.</p>\n\n<p>JMVC's goodies are broken down into four sub-projects:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>[jquerymx jQueryMX] - jQuery MVC and DOM extensions</li>\n<li>[stealjs StealJS] - JavaScript and CSS dependency management and build tools</li>\n<li>[FuncUnit] - Functional and Unit Testing framework</li>\n<li>[DocumentJS] - Documentation Engine</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>JavaScriptMVC is extremely modular. You can use each sub-project together or \nseparately (via the [http://javascriptmvc.com/builder.html download builder]). This means\nthat you can start small, using only [jQuery.Controller $.Controller] and add in parts\nof the framework as necessary. </p>\n\n<p>If you are new to the framework, this page followed by \nthe [tutorials tutorials and Guides] is the best place to start.</p>\n\n<p>The remainder of this page highlights what is in each project. Click \nthe the project links on the left for a more in-depth overview \nof each project.</p>\n\n<h2>jQueryMX</h2>\n\n<p>[jquerymx jQueryMX] is a collection of useful jQuery libraries that provide \nthe missing functionality necessary to implement and organize\nlarge-scale jQuery applications. For example, it includes things like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A [jQuery.Class class] system</li>\n<li>Special events like [jQuery.Drag drag]-[jQuery.Drop drop] and [jQuery.event.special.resize resize]</li>\n<li>Language helpers like [jQuery.toJSON toJSON] and an [jQuery.Observe observable system]</li>\n<li>DOM extensions for things like [jQuery.Range text ranges] and [jQuery.cookie cookies]</li>\n<li>Browser history [jQuery.route routing].</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>jQueryMX also puts the MVC in JavaScript with $.Model,\n$.View, and $.Controller.  [jQuery.Model Models] connect to your\nserver over a RESTful JSON interface.  [jQuery.View Views] are super-charged \nclient side templates.  [jQuery.Controller Controllers] prevent \nmemory leaks with declarative event handling.</p>\n\n<p>jQueryMX is very lightweight.  It's MVC libraries combined (including their $.Class dependency) are 7kb minified\nand gzipped.  Furthermore, you can use every part of jQueryMX independently of JavaScriptMVC \nand even independently of other parts of jQueryMX.  For example, you can use $.Controller without $.Model.</p>\n\n<h2>StealJS</h2>\n\n<p>[stealjs StealJS] is a \"code manager\" that keeps your code beautiful and organized\nwhile developing and FAST for users in production.  Its collection of command-line and\nbrowser-based utilities enable you to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>[steal load] JS, CSS, LESS, and CoffeeScript files and build them into a single production file.</li>\n<li>[steal.generate generate] an application file/folder structure, complete with test, build and documentation scripts.</li>\n<li>[steal.get install] 3rd party dependencies.</li>\n<li>[steal.clean clean and JSLint] your code.</li>\n<li>make your Ajax app [steal.html crawlable].</li>\n<li>log [steal.dev messages] in development that get removed in production builds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>[stealjs StealJS] is a stand-alone tool that can be used without the rest of JavaScriptMVC.</p>\n\n<h2>FuncUnit</h2>\n\n<p>[FuncUnit] is a web application testing framework that provides automated unit and \nfunctional testing.  Tests are written and debugged in the browser with\nFuncUnit's short, terse, jQuery-like API.  The same tests can be instantly \nautomated, run by Envjs or Selenium.  </p>\n\n<p>FuncUnit also supports extremely accurate [Syn event simulation] on practically every browser and\nsystem.</p>\n\n<h2>DocumentJS</h2>\n\n<p>[DocumentJS] provides powerful JavaScript documenting \ncapabilities.  This whole website is built with it! DocumentJS can document practically \nanything.  It's extensible.  And with Markdown support, it's easy to document your code.</p>", "title": "JavaScriptMVC", "src": "../jmvc/pages/init.js", "children": ["FuncUnit", "jquerymx", "stealjs", "examples", "tutorials"]})
