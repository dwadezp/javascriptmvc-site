C({"name": "mvc", "type": "page", "comment": "<p>[jquerymx jQueryMX] is JavaScriptMVC's collection \nof useful jQuery extensions.  Every part of jQueryMX can be used without\nevery other part, making the library extremely lightweight. Its Class, Model, View, \nand Controller combined are only 7k minified and compressed, yet \neven they can be used independently. jQueryMX's independence \nlets you start small and scale to meet the challenges of the most \ncomplex applications on the web.</p>\n\n<p>This tutorial covers <strong>only</strong> jQueryMX's $.Class, \n$.Model, $.View, and $.Controller.  The following describes each component:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>[jQuery.Class $.Class] - JavaScript based class system</li>\n<li>[jQuery.Model $.Model] - traditional model layer</li>\n<li>[jQuery.View $.View] - client side template system</li>\n<li>[jQuery.Controller $.Controller] - jQuery widget factory</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>jQueryMX's naming conventions deviate slightly from the \ntraditional <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller#Concepts\">Model-View-Controller</a> \ndesign pattern. $.Controller is used to create traditional \nview controls, like pagination buttons and list, as well as \ntraditional controllers, which coordinate between the \ntraditional views and models.</p>\n\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<p>JavaScriptMVC can be used as a single download that includes the entire framework.  But since \nthis chapter covers only the MVC parts, go to \nthe <a href=\"http://javascriptmvc.com/builder.html\">download builder</a>, check Controller, Model, \nand View's EJS templates and click download.  </p>\n\n<p>The download will come with minified and unminified versions of jQuery and \nthe plugins you selected.  Load these with script tags in your page:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='jquery-1.6.1.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  \n&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='jquerymx-1.0.custom.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please continue to [mvc.class Class].</p>", "title": "Get Started with jQueryMX", "parents": ["tutorials"], "order": 2, "src": "tutorials/mvc/mvc.md", "children": ["mvc.model", "mvc.view"]})
